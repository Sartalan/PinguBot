# PinguBot

### A simple penguin robot

Penguin robot is not defined yet, his behaviour is not defined and the technology's for build him already are not decided.

The goal in a future is to rewrite this README with the correct information about it so i can build him.
Right now i'm trying to get inspiration for build it, if something like that is posible in first place.

English isn't my native language, so if someone in a future is reading it, i'm so sorry; I'm still improving my English level daily.

For now the branch tree will be like this:

## Branches

+ There will be one branch called "main" which will have all the principal hardware content of the penguin robot, as the 3D design, the electronic circuit and the mathematic theory.
+ There will be one branch called "Web" which will have a web/blog where I'll be writing about the progress of the robot. 

For now that's the way I will work on my project.
